## Data Modelling
To optimize the performance of the data model, a calendar table was created using the DAX function. The data model follows a star schema with one fact table and three dimension tables. The dimension tables have PRIMARY KEYS that connect to the corresponding FOREIGN KEYS in the fact table, forming a one-to-many relationship between each dimension table and the fact table. The diagram below shows the data model.

## Report Design and Visualization
The Report Canvas was designed in Power Point and imported to PowerBI as canvas background. Here is a sample of the slide in Power Point

5 pages were created; Home, Consolidated, Stationery, Cosmetics and Electronics. 
_Home_ page is the landing page while _Consolidated_ has the general report without filter while other pages has filtered reports accroding to their page name.
On each page, the new card visual is used to hold Total Sales, Gross Sales and Profit, Line Chart is used for the series analysis while a column and bar chart are adopted for the Continental and Country analysis respectively. The last image is the button for page navigation.
